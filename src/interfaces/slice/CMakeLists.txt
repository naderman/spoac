# This file doesn't actually build the ice files.

# using the list of .ice files given in slice_sources.cmake.

#
# Install all the .ice files, so other projects can use them.
# Install sub-directory will be the same as the current sub-directory
# which is typically the same as the name of the Slice module, e.g. 'orca'
